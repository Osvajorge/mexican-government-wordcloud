# Mexican Goverment WordCloud

This is a short exercise to plot the 4th government report by the president of Mexico AMLO.

## Introduction
In this project, python web scraping tools are used to have a simple sight of the most common words used in 4th government report by the president of Mexico, the speech can be found on [president's website](https://lopezobrador.org.mx/2022/09/01/discurso-del-presidente-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-en-el-cuarto-informe-de-gobierno/).

After retrieving our data set using **BeautifulSoup**,  **word_cloud** is used to  convert our obtained text into a word cloud image in order to focus on the words used on it.  

In addition some repeated and not relevant words are included in the "exclusion" word list, 

## Result

Here is the *.png* plot image result with 20.000 words:
